<h1> The rooms in my house</h1>
<p> My house is a big house. I love it because it is so spacious. There are particular rooms
    I love about this house. The first one being my <a href="./bedroom.html" > bedroom </a><!--Insert link-->,
    I spend almost 9 hours sleeping in there so it has to be my favorite room in the whole house. Another one of my favorite is the 
    <a href="./bathroom.html" > bathroom </a>  <!--Insert link-->. My bathroom is pure white and thats how I like it so because it shows
    that I keep it clean at all times! </p>

<p> The <a href="./kitchen.html" > kitchen </a> <!--Insert link--> is my third favorite and I like it because that's the where the cooking magic happens.
    I really like a clean kitchen but it is not all-white like the bathroom, instead I put together 
    neutral colors together and it looks really nice. Lastly, the <a href="./garden.html" >garden </a> <!--Insert link-->. I love being in the garden
    during spring time because it smells really good and fresh. </p>
